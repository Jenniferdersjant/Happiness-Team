## Background
Starting with its first publication in 2012, the World Happiness Report has been aiming to provide a standardised quantified view on happiness across the world's nations. It's goal is to prompt professionals in health, government, and economy into action by providing them with a high-level estimate of the impact their areas of expertise have on national happiness.

We want to take the available data from world happiness reports to understand if there is a pattern between relevant COVID-19 metrics from the past year and the way world happiness has defeveloped as per report.

Happiness is in the report - and hence in this analysis - is measured according to the principle of the Cantril Ladder as below:

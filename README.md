## Background

It’s probably not an exaggeration to say that everyone among us has asked him- or herself once what it means to be happy. What is happiness? Am I happy? What can I do to achieve happiness? While these questions may sound pretty metaphysical, they are extremely suitable to the newfound focus on mental health that has surged over the past year.

During the COVID-pandemic many of us saw themselves confined to their own four walls with some countries imposing extensive lookdowns across multiple weeks. Even a home office that sounded oh so great at the beginning, resulted in blurry boundaries between private and professional life for many of us, actually increasing stress levels caused at work. 

So, when many individuals are struggling, how then can we improve happiness levels ideally for a wider population?

Picking up on this thought, this paper looks at the World Happiness Report to understand the most prevalent quantitative definition of happiness and which factors play into happiness on a national level. Our goal - thereby - is to understand what the relevant factors are to allow a better understanding of where potential actions could follow.

## The World Happiness Report

Starting with its first publication in 2012, the World Happiness Report has been aiming to provide a standardised quantified view on happiness across the world's nations. It's goal is to prompt professionals in health, government, and economy into action by providing them with a high-level estimate of the impact their areas of expertise have on national happiness.

We want to take the available data from world happiness reports to understand if there is a pattern between relevant COVID-19 metrics from the past year and the way world happiness has defeveloped as per report.

Happiness is in the report - and hence in this analysis - is measured according to the principle of the Cantril Ladder as below:

In this setting responses are combination of the respondent's currently perceived life satisfcation as well as their outlook on how this will change in the mid-term (5 years).

## Methodology
...

## Data
Variables: as we might already know, not one factor can explain the underlying happiness of a person or nation, that is why different variables are used to calculate the happiness scores. The authors of the World Happiness Report have found seven key factors that could likely explain the levels of happiness:

<ol type = "1">
         <li>The first variable is the GDP or gross domestic product, which is simply the sum of the values of all the goods produced in a country annually. To get to the GDP per capita, this sum is divided by the population.</li>
         <li>Social support is also a key variable, this is based on a yes or no answer to the following question: “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?” Based on the yes/no answer a dummy variable is created, where yes equals 1 and a 0 has been allocated to a no. Based on these scores, an average score is calculated, which represents the level of social support. </li>
         <li>The third variable is healthy life expectancy, which stands for the number of years a newborn is expected to live. This is based on 100 different factors, calculated and maintained by the World Health Organization. </li>
         <li>Freedom to make life choices, similar to the social support factor, is also answered using one question: “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?” to which a dummy variable has been created as well. </li>
         <li>In addition to this, the generosity factor is also calculated based on the following question: “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?”.
Perceptions of corruption are averaged based on two questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” & “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”</li>
         <li>The last variable is the ladder score, which is explained above.</li>
</ol>
